Thank you for your interest in contacting me! This page provides useful information on how to best get in touch.

If you'd like to get in touch, please send me an email at kevinw[at]berkeley.edu. Reaching out to me through social media networks such as LinkedIn is less likely to warrant a response as I find it difficult to have direct conversations on social media and don't check them regularly. Even when I do see a message, I usually end up asking for an email address so I can reply more easily.

Thank you for your interest! I usually only accept virtual talks due to my schedule and commitments. When composing your email, please let me know the context of the talk (hackathon, workshop, seminar), the intended audience, scheduling details, and preferred talk topics. Ideally, reach out at least 2-4 weeks before your event.

Please let me know in your email how we can best support you and details of your event (number of attendees, venue, scheduling details, etc). Ideally, reach out at least 1-2 months before your event as setting up sponsorships take time.

You can also schedule a brief coffee chat with me [here](https://zcal.co/i/4muIspa7). When scheduling a coffee chat, you'll be prompted to fill out topics you'd like to discuss. Please fill this section out, as it will help me better prepare for our chat!
