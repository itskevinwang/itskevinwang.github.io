For now, this page is assumed to be a static description of your courses. You can convert it to a collection similar to `_projects/` so that you can have a dedicated page for each course.

If you'd like to get in touch, please send me an email at kevinw[at]berkeley.edu. I'm not as likely to respond to messages on LinkedIn or other platforms. You can also schedule a brief coffee chat with me [here](https://zcal.co/i/4muIspa7).
