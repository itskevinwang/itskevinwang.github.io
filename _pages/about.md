I am a third-year undergraduate Computer Science student at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) where I'm advised by [Prof. Gašper Beguš](https://gbegus.github.io/) within the [Berkeley Speech and Computation Lab](https://twitter.com/BerkeleySCLab).

I am broadly interested in deep learning for speech and computational linguistics as well as natural language processing techniques for language studies. My current research focuses on the development of deep learning models for speech data and using speech to understand how neural nets learn. I am currently working as a Software Engineer at [NVIDIA Corporation](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/) on NVIDIA AI Enterprise, LLMs, and Gen AI. I am also working within [Project CETI (Cetacean Translation Initiative)](https://www.projectceti.org/), a scientist-led nonprofit organization and [TED Audacious Project](https://www.audaciousproject.org/grantees/project-ceti) applying advanced machine learning and gentle robotics to listen to and translate the communication of sperm whales.

Previously, I worked as a Research Intern at [MIT Lincoln Laboratory](https://www.ll.mit.edu/) and as an NSF REU Fellow at the [Spatiotemporal Innovation Center](https://www.stcenter.net/). I have also worked on projects for the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, and The Alan Turing Institute.
