I am a third-year undergraduate Computer Science student at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) where I'm advised by [Prof. Gašper Beguš](https://gbegus.github.io/) within the [Berkeley Speech and Computation Lab](https://twitter.com/BerkeleySCLab).

I am broadly interested in deep learning for speech and computational linguistics.

Previously, I worked as a Research Intern at [MIT Lincoln Laboratory](https://www.ll.mit.edu/) and as a NSF REU Fellow at the [Spatiotemporal Innovation Center](https://www.stcenter.net/). I have also worked on projects for the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, and The Alan Turing Institute.
